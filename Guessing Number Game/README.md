“Higher or Lower” Guessing Game
     	
Write a program that will allow the user to play a game where they will try to guess a random number between 1 and 1024.  If their guess is wrong, the program will display that it was incorrect and tell them to guess again.

The program will start by generating a random number between 1 and 1024 inclusively.  Then ask the user to guess what the number is.  If the user’s guess is higher than the random number, the program should display “Too high, try again.”  If the user’s guess is lower than the random number, the program should display “Too low, try again.”  The program should use a do-loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.  

Also, you will need to keep a count of the number of guesses that the user makes.  When the user correctly guesses the random number, the program should display the number of guesses.  If the total number of guesses is greater then ten, let them know that they need to consider playing a new game.

Input and output should be done with Dialog and Message boxes.
